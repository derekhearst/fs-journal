## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
   The primary key is the unique identifier for a table, and the foreign key is the unique identifier for a table that is referenced in another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?
   An alias is a temporary name for a table or column.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

Select d.id, p.* from doctorsPatients dp
inner join doctors d on d.id = dp.doctorId
inner join patients p on p.id = dp.patientId



```
