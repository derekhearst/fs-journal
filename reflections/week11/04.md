## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I've really enjoyed my time at CodeWorks. I've learned a lot and I'm excited to continue learning. I've finished the backend already and I plan to finish the frontend quickly.
