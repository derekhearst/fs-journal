## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
Only letting code that accesses a class call the methods in the class and not the private helper functions inside the file

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
underscore prefix still lets the user access the function, even though they shouldn't

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
You can use # to create a private variable, however it's better practice to encapsulate your data elsewhere.
