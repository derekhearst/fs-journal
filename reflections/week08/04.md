   Component testing - testing components in isolation
   End to end testing - testing the whole app

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
   End to end testing is what i find most helpful, because it can be done without writing code to test automatically.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
   Unit testing, depending on the specific part of the project, simple functions often don't need to have tests written for them.
