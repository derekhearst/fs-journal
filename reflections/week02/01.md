## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
Scope is kinda like the accessability of variables, a variable nested in brackets can't be accessed outside those brackets

2. What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is when the JS gets run, the variables move to the top of their scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
You will probably use let and const much more than var, let is var but not outdated, and you will use it for most variables, const is let but for constant values.
