## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
   Value types, Reference types, and Pointer types,
   You can modify value without changing the original value, reference types are the opposite, and pointer types are used to access memory directly.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
   Boolean, Char, Int, Float, Double, Decimal, and Enum. There are many more datatypes to represent a number in C# than in JavaScript.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
   Reference types get stored in memory by using a pointer to the location of the value. Value types get stored in memory by using the value itself.
