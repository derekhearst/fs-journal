## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
   A row is a record, and a column is a field.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
   CREATE TABLE characters (
   id INT,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   age VARCHAR(255),
   description VARCHAR(255)
   );

3. What are the difference between the following statements:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

    	Delete removes all the records from a table, while drop deletes the table itself.
