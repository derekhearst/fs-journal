## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
It allows you to quickly find problems in your UI design, before structuring it out in code which can be harder to change

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low, mid, and high fidelity, low is used for quick sketches and general layouts, mid can be useful but not as useful as high fidelity, which is close to the finished product

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
A low fidelity wire-frame is certainly worth it, as it allows you to find issues with your design and flesh out your ideas onto paper much more quickly than it takes to build in html
